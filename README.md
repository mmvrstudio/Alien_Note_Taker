    - To use the application locally, run node server.js in your Integrated Terminal (ex: VS Studio Code Terminal - right cliick above index html to open it)
    -  Open the index.html in the Live server, then paste http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browswer.
    -  Use the app and save your notes :)
